Tables
work best when the display will be used to look up individual values or the quantitative values must be precise. 

Graphs
work best when the message you wish to communicate resides in the shape of the data (that is, in patterns, trends, and exceptions). 

Graphs are typically 1 quantitative scale with 1 or more categorical scales (except scatterplots which are 2 quantitave scales)

3 types of categorical scales:
  Nominal - differ in name only, no order (regions and departments)
  Ordinal - intrinsic order, not quantitative (A,B,C; small, medium, large; poor, etc.)
  Interval - Bins or ranges (0-99, 100-199, etc.; months)
